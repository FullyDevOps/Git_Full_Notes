### üîç **1. Common Git Problems & Fixes**

#### ‚ùå **Problem: `fatal: not a git repository`**
*   **What it means:** Git can't find a `.git` directory in the current path or any parent directory.
*   **Root Causes:**
    *   You're **not inside a Git repository** (most common).
    *   You're in a **subdirectory** of a repo, but the `.git` folder is missing/corrupted.
    *   You're in a **bare repository** (has no working tree, only `.git` contents).
    *   Filesystem permissions prevent Git from accessing `.git`.
    *   You're inside a **Git submodule** but haven't initialized it (`git submodule update --init`).
*   **Solutions:**
    1.  **Verify your location:**  
        ```bash
        pwd          # Check current directory
        ls -la .git  # Does .git exist? (Linux/macOS)
        dir .git     # (Windows CMD)
        ```
    2.  **Navigate to the repo root:**  
        ```bash
        cd /path/to/your/repo  # Go to the directory containing .git
        ```
    3.  **Initialize a new repo (if intentional):**  
        ```bash
        git init
        ```
    4.  **Recover a missing `.git` folder (if deleted):**  
        *   Restore from backup.
        *   Recreate repo & re-add remote:  
            ```bash
            git init
            git remote add origin <repo-url>
            git fetch
            git checkout -b main origin/main  # Or your default branch
            ```
    5.  **Check submodule status:**  
        ```bash
        git submodule status  # If output shows `-` prefix, initialize it:
        git submodule update --init
        ```
*   **Critical Notes:**
    *   Git **requires** the `.git` folder to function. No `.git` = no Git.
    *   **Never delete `.git`** unless you intend to destroy repo history.
    *   Bare repos (e.g., on servers) **only contain** `.git` contents‚Äîno working files.

#### ‚ùå **Problem: `cannot pull, you have uncommitted changes`**
*   **What it means:** Git refuses to overwrite your local uncommitted changes during a `git pull` (which combines `fetch` + `merge`).
*   **Root Causes:**
    *   Modified tracked files exist in your working directory.
    *   Staged changes exist (in index) but aren't committed.
*   **Why Git Blocks This:**  
    A `pull` tries to *merge* new commits. If you have local changes, Git can't safely apply the merge without risking data loss.
*   **Solutions (Choose ONE):**
    1.  **Commit your changes (Recommended for intentional work):**  
        ```bash
        git add .                  # Stage changes
        git commit -m "Your message"
        git pull                   # Now safe to pull
        ```
    2.  **Stash changes (Temporarily save work):**  
        ```bash
        git stash push -u -m "WIP"  # -u includes untracked files
        git pull                    # Pull succeeds
        git stash pop               # Reapply changes (may cause conflicts)
        ```
    3.  **Discard changes (Only if you want to lose them):**  
        ```bash
        git reset --hard HEAD      # Discards ALL staged/unstaged changes
        git clean -fd              # Removes untracked files/dirs (USE CAUTION!)
        git pull
        ```
    4.  **Force overwrite (DANGEROUS - use only if you know what you're doing):**  
        ```bash
        git fetch origin
        git reset --hard origin/main  # Replaces your branch with remote's state (DESTROYS local changes)
        ```
*   **Critical Notes:**
    *   `git pull --rebase` **also fails** with uncommitted changes (same reason).
    *   **`git stash -u`** is crucial if you have new files (untracked).
    *   **NEVER** use `reset --hard` unless you've backed up changes‚Äîyou **WILL lose data**.

#### ‚ùå **Problem: `Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by X commits`**
*   **What it means:** Your local branch hasn't been updated with commits from the remote branch.
*   **Root Causes:**
    *   Someone pushed new commits to the remote branch (`origin/main`).
    *   You haven't run `git fetch` or `git pull` recently.
*   **Why It Happens:**  
    Git tracks the state of `origin/main` locally in `.git/refs/remotes/origin/main`. If remote has new commits, your local tracking reference is outdated.
*   **Solutions:**
    1.  **Standard Pull (Merge):**  
        ```bash
        git pull origin main  # Fetches + merges remote into local
        ```
    2.  **Rebase (Cleaner history - preferred for feature branches):**  
        ```bash
        git pull --rebase origin main  # Fetches, then replays your commits on top
        ```
    3.  **Manual Fetch + Merge/Rebase (More control):**  
        ```bash
        git fetch origin         # Updates remote-tracking branches ONLY
        git merge origin/main    # Or: git rebase origin/main
        ```
*   **Critical Notes:**
    *   **`git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`** by default. Use `--rebase` to avoid merge commits.
    *   If you have **local commits**, pulling may cause a **merge conflict** (see next section).
    *   **Never force-push (`git push -f`)** to a shared branch just to "fix" being behind‚Äîthis rewrites history and breaks others' work.

#### ‚ùå **Problem: `Merge conflict in [file]`**
*   **What it means:** Git couldn't automatically combine changes from two branches because they modified the **same part** of a file.
*   **Root Causes:**
    *   Both branches changed the same lines in a file.
    *   One branch deleted a file the other modified.
    *   File was modified in one branch and renamed in the other.
*   **How Git Marks Conflicts (in the file):**
    ```diff
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Your local changes
    =======
    Incoming remote changes
    >>>>>>> commit-hash
    ```
    *   `HEAD` = Your current branch's version.
    *   `commit-hash` = The incoming version from the other branch.
*   **Why Conflicts Happen:**  
    Git uses a 3-way merge (common ancestor + branch A + branch B). If changes overlap and aren't trivially combinable, human intervention is needed.

### üîß **2. Debugging Merge Conflicts**

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Resolution (Most Common)**
1.  **Identify conflicted files:**  
    ```bash
    git status  # Shows "Unmerged paths"
    ```
2.  **Open conflicted files:**  
    Look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers.
3.  **Resolve conflicts:**  
    *   **Choose one version:** Delete the losing section + markers.
    *   **Combine changes:** Manually edit to include both changes logically.
    *   **Discard both:** Remove all conflict markers and write new content.
4.  **Mark as resolved:**  
    ```bash
    git add <resolved-file>  # Stages the fixed file
    ```
5.  **Complete the merge:**  
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Merge branch 'feature' into main"  # Git auto-creates this message
    ```
*   **Pro Tips:**
    *   Use `git diff --base <file>` to see changes from common ancestor.
    *   `git checkout --ours <file>` keeps YOUR version (during merge).
    *   `git checkout --theirs <file>` keeps THEIR version (during merge).

#### üß∞ **Using Merge Tools (GUI)**
*   **Why use them:** Visual diff tools make complex conflicts easier to resolve.
*   **Setup & Usage:**
    1.  **Configure a tool** (e.g., VS Code, KDiff3, Beyond Compare):  
        ```bash
        git config --global merge.tool vscode  # Example for VS Code
        git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'
        ```
    2.  **Launch the tool:**  
        ```bash
        git mergetool  # Opens configured tool for each conflicted file
        ```
    3.  **Resolve in GUI:**  
        *   Left pane = Local (HEAD)
        *   Right pane = Remote (Incoming)
        *   Center pane = Result (edit here)
    4.  **Save & exit:** Tool marks file as resolved automatically.
*   **Popular Tools:**
    *   **VS Code:** Built-in merge editor (triggered by `git mergetool`).
    *   **KDiff3:** Free, cross-platform (great for 3-way diffs).
    *   **Beyond Compare:** Paid, industry standard (powerful).
    *   **P4Merge:** Free from Perforce (excellent visualizer).

#### üö´ **Aborting a Merge: `git merge --abort`**
*   **When to use:** If a merge goes wrong and you want to **completely undo** it, returning to the state *before* the merge started.
*   **How it works:**  
    Resets `HEAD`, index, and working tree to the pre-merge commit. **Discards all merge progress.**
*   **Usage:**  
    ```bash
    git merge --abort
    ```
*   **Critical Notes:**
    *   **Only works during an *active* merge** (i.e., after conflict but before commit).
    *   **Does NOT work** if you've already committed the merge.
    *   **Does NOT recover** uncommitted local changes you had *before* the merge started (those were stashed by Git during merge start‚Äîcheck `git status` after abort).
    *   **Safer than `reset --hard`** because it specifically targets merge state.

### ‚ö° **3. Large Repository Performance**

#### üì¶ **Optimizing `.git` Size**
*   **Why it matters:** Huge `.git` folders slow down `clone`, `fetch`, `status`, and disk operations.
*   **Common Culprits:**
    *   Accidental inclusion of large binaries (logs, datasets, binaries).
    *   History of large files (even if deleted later‚ÄîGit retains them).
    *   Unoptimized packfiles.
*   **Diagnosis Commands:**
    ```bash
    git count-objects -vH        # Shows pack size, garbage, etc.
    git rev-list --objects --all | grep "$(git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/*.idx | sort -k 3 -n | tail -5 | awk '{print$1}')"  # Find largest objects
    bfg-repo-cleaner --list-large-commits  # (External tool) Lists big commits
    ```

#### üßπ **`git gc` (Garbage Collection)**
*   **What it does:**  
    Cleans up unnecessary files and **optimizes local repository**:
    *   Compresses loose objects into packfiles.
    *   Removes unreachable objects (after `reset --hard`, `rebase`, etc.).
    *   Prunes reflogs (older than 90 days by default).
*   **When to run:**
    *   After many commits/rewrites (`rebase`, `filter-branch`).
    *   If `git count-objects` shows large "garbage" or "size-pack".
    *   Before sharing a repo (e.g., `git bundle`).
*   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    git gc --aggressive --prune=now  # Deep optimization (slower, more space saved)
    git gc                           # Standard cleanup
    ```
*   **Critical Notes:**
    *   **`--aggressive`** recompresses *all* packfiles (CPU-intensive).
    *   **`--prune=now`** deletes *all* unreachable objects immediately (use cautiously!).
    *   Git runs `gc` automatically when needed (e.g., after 68+ loose objects).

#### üì¶ **`git repack`**
*   **What it does:**  
    **Repacks existing packfiles** into fewer/more efficient packfiles. More granular control than `git gc`.
*   **When to use:**
    *   You have many small packfiles (e.g., after frequent `gc`).
    *   You need maximum compression (e.g., before `git clone` for others).
*   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    git repack -d -l -A --threads=4  # -d: delete old packs, -l: local (no reuse), -A: all refs
    ```
*   **Critical Notes:**
    *   **`-d` is essential** to save space (deletes old packs after repack).
    *   **`-l`** uses local objects only (faster, less network).
    *   **More threads (`--threads=N`)** speed up compression on multi-core systems.

#### üíæ **Handling Binary Files (Git LFS - Large File Storage)**
*   **Why standard Git fails with binaries:**
    *   Binaries are **not diffable** ‚Üí Every change stores a full copy.
    *   Bloated `.git` folder ‚Üí Slow clones, huge disk usage.
    *   History becomes unusable (e.g., `git blame` on binaries is meaningless).
*   **How Git LFS Works:**
    1.  **Track patterns:** `git lfs track "*.psd"` creates `.gitattributes`.
    2.  **Pointer files:** When you `git add`, LFS stores a **small text pointer** in Git:  
        `version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1\noid sha256:4d7a21...`
    3.  **Real files:** Actual binaries are stored in **LFS server** (not Git repo).
    4.  **On `git clone`:** Git downloads pointers; LFS client fetches real files.
*   **Setup & Usage:**
    ```bash
    # Install LFS: https://git-lfs.com
    git lfs install                   # One-time setup per machine

    # Track file types (DO THIS BEFORE ADDING FILES!)
    git lfs track "*.psd" "*.zip" "*.iso"

    # Commit .gitattributes (CRITICAL!)
    git add .gitattributes
    git commit -m "Track binaries with LFS"

    # Add/commit binaries normally
    git add large.psd
    git commit -m "Add design file"
    git push
    ```
*   **Critical Notes:**
    *   **Track patterns BEFORE adding files!** Adding first stores full binaries in Git history (hard to remove).
    *   **LFS requires server support:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket have built-in LFS. Self-hosted needs `git-lfs-server`.
    *   **Migration is hard:** If binaries are *already in history*, use `git lfs migrate` (complex, backup first!).
    *   **Not for small binaries:** Only use for files >100KB that change frequently. Small binaries are fine in Git.
    *   **Bandwidth costs:** LFS storage/transfer often has separate quotas (check your provider).

### üö® **Proactive Best Practices to Avoid These Issues**
1.  **`.gitignore` is mandatory:** Exclude build artifacts, logs, IDE files, binaries.
2.  **Commit small, often:** Reduces merge conflict scope.
3.  **Pull/rebase frequently:** Stay close to `origin/main`.
4.  **Use branches:** Isolate features; merge via PRs.
5.  **Never store secrets/large files in Git:** Use `.gitignore` + LFS for binaries.
6.  **Verify repo health monthly:**  
    ```bash
    git fsck             # Check integrity
    git count-objects -vH  # Monitor .git size
    ```
